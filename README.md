# xenomat

A scalable platform for microservices and IoT applications, based on the [netropy VM](https://netropy.online).

Used in embedded systems, it represents the shortest path from your hardware to your browser, making it ideal for IoT edges.

This is the XENOmat API. Runtimes for download on the [XENOmat homepage](https://netropy.ch/xenomat).

Available for Linux (incl. Raspberry Pi), Windows, and MacOS. More to follow.


The core engine is extensible with services written in C/C++, e.g. https://github.com/huebel/macbook.
